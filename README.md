# Docker GCP private mirror

This project was created with the aim of using an image mirror from Artifact Registry in a Kubernetes cluster (GKE) within Google Cloud Platform. It addresses several issues, the first being the ability to call a mirror that contains a URL with a URI, not just a hostname (it is possible that Containerd now supports this, but that has not always been the case). It also leverages Workload Identity to automatically add an authorization header to all requests sent to the Artifact Registry image mirror.

## Deployment using helm

Before proceeding with the installation, you must have deployed an Artifact Registry repository, have a cluster with Workload Identity enabled, and possess a GCP user with permissions to read from your repository. An (Opentofu example)[tests/tofu] is available in the tests folder without the GKE cluster deployment.

### Minimum Configuration

```yaml
fullnameOverride: gcp-mirror
nginx:
  proxy:
    # Depends on the location of your Artifact Registry repository.
    upstreamHost: "europe-docker.pkg.dev"
    # This is the missing URI in the mirror configuration to access the repository.
    # It is composed of the Google project ID and the name of the Artifact Registry repository.
    rewritePath: "gcp_project/registry_name"
serviceAccount:
  annotations:
    # Properly link the Kubernetes service account with the Google service account so that the sidecar can generate the tokens.
    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: my-gcp-sa@my-sa-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

### Command line

```sh
helm install gcp-mirror oci://registry-1.docker.io/sguesdon/docker-gcp-private-mirror --version 0.0.1
```

### Using the Helm chart as a Helm dependency

```yaml
# Chart.yaml
#Â [...]
dependencies:
  - name: docker-gcp-private-mirror
    alias: gcp-mirror
    version: 0.0.1
    repository: oci://registry-1.docker.io/sguesdon
# [...]
```

## All values

Other configurations are available, including settings related to the NGINX cache. The behavior of the sidecar responsible for retrieving the Google token can also be modified. All the values are available [here](src/values.yaml).

## Requirements to run tests locally

To quickly run the project, you need to use [DevBox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing_devbox/) and [direnv](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/ide_configuration/direnv/). I encourage you to install it.

You will need Kubernetes locally to run the tests. Currently, the tests have already been successfully executed on the Kubernetes provided by Docker Desktop and on Minikube.

> Before running your tests, you must ensure that `kubectl` is properly configured to connect to your local cluster.

## Quick Deployment for Testing

If you want to quickly test the solution, you can do so using the Opentofu project located in the [following folder](tests/tofu).
However, you will need to have gcloud properly configured and an active GKE cluster with Workload Identity enabled.

Before deploying the solution, make sure to fill in the minimum configurations in the `terraform.tfvars` file. The `terraform.tfvars.example` file contains the minimum required information.

```sh
cd tests/tofu
tofu init
tofu apply
```

After installation, you can quickly test the solution using the following commands:

```sh
kubectl run dind --rm -it --image=docker:dind --privileged -- --insecure-registry docker-mirror --registry-mirror http://docker-mirror
kubectl exec -it dind -- docker pull redis:latest
```

## Running tests

Before running the tests, ensure that you have a functional Kubernetes cluster in your development environment.

> If you are using Minikube, you will need to set the following variable: `MINIKUBE=true`

```sh
devbox run test
```

## Lint helm chart

```sh
devbox run lint
```
